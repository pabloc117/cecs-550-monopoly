# Importing Property Information #

All property information is stored in the file "property\_listing.xml" which is documented under PropertyListing.

When the GameBoard is initialized, it will parse the property listing file using the ThemeParser and build a dictionary of properties.  Using that dictionary, it will fill in the appropriate spaces.
